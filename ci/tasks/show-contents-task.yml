# takes inputs and outputs 
# runs in temporary container
# acts as working directory, can output to different directors
# Do fundimental work of pipeline
# platoform: where to run task | image_resource:  which container image to run task | inputs: artifacts available in current directory when the task is run eg CLI paramters, outputs from previous task etc  | outputs: directory available to later steps in build plan
# resources are only durable stoarage mechanism in a pipeline
# when you add an input it creates a directory with the input | output exports that directory to make it available to other tasks.
# tasks outputs are stored on worker filesystem and mounted into containers for subsequent tasks within same job
# inputs - path: is the name of the folder that gets created for the input. name references the folder name
# run:
#   path: ./input-source-code/script1.sh
